# Titanic Dataset Analysis 🛳️📊

This project involves analyzing the **Titanic dataset** to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival, including factors such as class, age, sex, and the embarked location.

## Overview ✨

This task was part of my internship at **Skillcraft Technology**, where I:

- Explored survival trends by passenger characteristics such as class, age, sex, and embarked location.
- Visualized the distribution of survivors vs non-survivors across various factors.
- Generated actionable insights for improving predictive models for survival.

## Project Structure 🗂️

- **`/data`**: Contains the raw and cleaned Titanic dataset.
- **`/notebooks`**: Jupyter notebooks with the analysis code.
- **`/visualizations`**: Saved visualizations like graphs and plots.
- 
## Key Highlights 🌟

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, dealt with categorical data, and ensured the dataset was ready for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
    - Analyzed survival trends using **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.
    - Identified relationships between survival rates and passenger features.
- **Visualizations**: 
    - Created visualizations to illustrate key findings, including survival distribution by class, age, and gender.
- **Insights**: Provided valuable insights into the Titanic disaster and how various factors impacted survival rates.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **Python**
- **Pandas** (data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (exploration)
